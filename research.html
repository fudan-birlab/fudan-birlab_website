                We link <strong>brain, intelligence, and robotics</strong>—deriving principles 
                from neural and behavioral evidence, modeling them into theories 
                and algorithms, and validating them in robotic tasks and scenarios.

                We investigate spatial cognition through multi-region neural recordings and behavioral evidence, uncovering how parallel pathways coordinate perception, memory, decision-making, and motor control during navigation.
                <!-- Neural mechanisms of spatial cognition -->
                <!-- We are trying to elucidate the neural basis of spatial navigation in the human brain using fMRI and in the mouse brain using fluorescence microscopy. By linking behaviors, brain connectivity and response, and neuronal activity together, it helps to understand how <i>what and where</i> visual pathways, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus support learning, memory, and decision-making during navigation. -->
                <!-- We aim to provide evidence of the neural mechanisms underlying
                <strong>spatial cognition</strong> in animals by analyzing
                behavioral patterns, brain activity, and neuronal firing, which
                are closely associated with perception, attention, learning,
                memory, planning, and decision-making. -->

                We aim to develop theories of intelligence by replicating neuronal activity with minimal computational models, modeling the whole mouse brain as a digital twin, explaining representation data through theory to predict experimental outcomes, and ultimately creating brain-inspired AI algorithms.

                    model</strong> in the simplest possible way with our deepest
